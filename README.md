In this laboratory we will examine harmonic oscillation. We will model the motion of a mass-spring

system with differential equations.

Our objectives are as follows:

1. Determine the effect of parameters on the solutions of differential equations.

2. Determine the behavior of the mass-spring system from the graph of the solution.

3. Determine the effect of the parameters on the behavior of the mass-spring.

The primary MATLAB command used is the ode45 function.

Mass-Spring System without Damping

The motion of a mass suspended to a vertical spring can be described as follows. When the spring is

not loaded it has length ‚Ñì0 (situation (a)). When a mass m is attached to its lower end it has length ‚Ñì

(situation (b)). From the first principle of mechanics we then obtain

|m{zg}

downward weight force

+ ‚àík(‚Ñì ‚àí ‚Ñì0) | {z }

upward tension force

= 0. (L5.1)

The term g measures the gravitational acceleration (g ‚âÉ 9.8m/s2 ‚âÉ 32ft/s2). The quantity k is a spring

constant measuring its stiffness. We now pull downwards on the mass by an amount y and let the mass

go (situation (c)). We expect the mass to oscillate around the position y = 0. The second principle of

mechanics yields

|m{zg}

weight

+ ‚àík(‚Ñì + y ‚àí ‚Ñì0) | {z }

upward tension force

= m

d2(‚Ñì + y)

dt2 | {z }

acceleration of mass

, i.e., m

d2y

dt2 + ky = 0 (L5.2)

using (L5.1). This ODE is second-order.

where œâ2

0 = k/m. Equation (L5.3) models simple harmonic motion. A numerical solution with initial

conditions y(0) = 0.1 meter and y‚Ä≤(0) = 0 (i.e., the mass is initially stretched downward 10cms

and released, see setting (c) in figure) is obtained by first reducing the ODE to first-order ODEs (see

Laboratory 4).

Let v = y‚Ä≤. Then v‚Ä≤ = y‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ = ‚àíœâ2

0y = ‚àí4y. Also v(0) = y‚Ä≤(0) = 0. The following MATLAB program

implements the problem (with œâ0 = 2).

function LAB05ex1

m = 1; % mass [kg]

k = 4; % spring constant [N/m]

omega0 = sqrt(k/m);

y0 = 0.1; v0 = 0; % initial conditions

[t,Y] = ode45(@f,[0,10],[y0,v0],[],omega0); % solve for 0&lt;t&lt;10

y = Y(:,1); v = Y(:,2); % retrieve y, v from Y

figure(1); plot(t,y,‚Äôb+-‚Äò,t,v,‚Äôro-‚Äò); % time series for y and v

grid on;

%‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì

function dYdt = f(t,Y,omega0)

y = Y(1); v = Y(2);

dYdt = [ v ; -omega0^2*y ];

Note that the parameter œâ0 was passed as an argument to ode45 rather than set to its value œâ0 = 2

directly in the function f. The advantage is that its value can easily be changed in the driver part of the

program rather than in the function, for example when multiple plots with different values of œâ0 need

to be compared in a single MATLAB figure window.

Figure L5a: Harmonic motion

1. From the graph in Fig. L5a answer the following questions.

(a) Which curve represents y = y(t)? How do you know?

(b) What is the period of the motion? Answer this question first graphically (by reading the

period from the graph) and then analytically (by finding the period using œâ0).

(c) We say that the mass comes to rest if, after a certain time, the position of the mass remains

within an arbitrary small distance from the equilibrium position. Will the mass ever come to

rest? Why?

(d) What is the amplitude of the oscillations for y?

(e) What is the maximum velocity (in magnitude) attained by the mass, and when is it attained?

Make sure you give all the t-values at which the velocity is maximum and the corresponding

maximum value. The t-values can be determined by magnifying the MATLAB figure using

the magnify button , and by using the periodicity of the velocity function.

(f) How does the size of the mass m and the stiffness k of the spring affect the motion?

Support your answer first with a theoretical analysis on how œâ0 ‚Äì and therefore the period

of the oscillation ‚Äì is related to m and k, and then graphically by running LAB05ex1.m first

with m = 5 and k = 4 and then with m = 1 and k = 16. Include the corresponding graphs.

2. The energy of the mass-spring system is given by the sum of the potential energy and kinetic

energy. In absence of damping, the energy is conserved.

(a) Plot the quantity E = 1

2mv2 + 1

2ky2 as a function of time. What do you observe? (pay close

attention to the y-axis scale and, if necessary, use ylim to get a better graph). Does the graph

confirm the fact that the energy is conserved?

(b) Show analytically that dE

dt = 0.(Note that this proves that the energy is constant).

(c) Plot v vs y (phase plot). Does the curve ever get close to the origin? Why or why not? What

does that mean for the mass-spring system?

Mass-Spring System with Damping

When the movement of the mass is damped due to viscous effects (e.g., the mass moves in a cylinder

containing oil, situation (d)), an additional term proportional to the velocity must be added. The

resulting equation becomes

m

d2y

dt2 + c

dy

dt

+ ky = 0 or

d2y

dt2 + 2p

dy

dt

+ œâ2

0y = 0 (L5.4)

by setting p = c

2m. The program LAB05ex1 is updated by modifying the function f:

function LAB05ex1a

m = 1; % mass [kg]

k = 4; % spring constant [N/m]

c = 1; % friction coefficient [Ns/m]

omega0 = sqrt(k/m); p = c/(2*m);

y0 = 0.1; v0 = 0; % initial conditions

[t,Y] = ode45(@f,[0,10],[y0,v0],[],omega0,p); % solve for 0&lt;t&lt;10

y = Y(:,1); v = Y(:,2); % retrieve y, v from Y

figure(1); plot(t,y,‚Äôb+-‚Äò,t,v,‚Äôro-‚Äò); % time series for y and v

grid on;

%‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

function dYdt = f(t,Y,omega0,p)

y = Y(1); v = Y(2);

dYdt = [ v ; ?? ]; % fill-in dv/dt

3. Fill in LAB05ex1a.m to reproduce Fig. L5b and then answer the following questions.

(a) For what minimal time t1 will the mass-spring system satisfy |y(t)| &lt; 0.01 for all t &gt; t1? You

can answer the question either by magnifying the MATLAB figure using the magnify button

(include a graph that confirms your answer), or use the following MATLAB commands

(explain):

(b) What is the maximum (in magnitude) velocity attained by the mass, and when is it attained?

Answer by using the magnify button and include the corresponding picture.

(c) How does the size of c affect the motion? To support your answer, run the file LAB05ex1.m

for c = 2, c = 4, c = 6 and c = 8. Include the corresponding graphs with a title indicating

the value of c used.

(d) Determine analytically the smallest (critical) value of c such that no oscillation appears in

the solution.

4. (a) Plot the quantity E = 1

2mv2 + 1

2ky2 as a function of time. What do you observe? Is the

energy conserved in this case?

(b) Show analytically that dE

dt &lt; 0 for c &gt; 0 while dE

dt &gt; 0 for c &lt; 0.

(c) Plot v vs y (phase plot). Comment on the behavior of the curve in the context of the motion

of the spring. Does the graph ever get close to the origin? Why or why not?
